## One Million Menu Loads Monthly

Along with reaching 10k stars, we are now seeing over **1 million menu loads per month** worldwide! This level of usage demonstrates how essential netboot.xyz has become for many of you in your daily workflows - whether you're deploying operating systems, performing system recovery, or using our utilities for maintenance tasks.

## A Thank You to the iPXE Project

This milestone would not have been possible without the foundation provided by the [iPXE project](https://ipxe.org/). We owe a special debt of gratitude to Michael Brown, the lead developer of iPXE, whose vision and dedication have created the robust network boot framework that powers netboot.xyz.

The entire iPXE community also deserves recognition for their continuous improvements, bug fixes, and new features that enable netboot.xyz to support a wide range of hardware and boot scenarios. Their commitment to open source has directly contributed to our success.

## Looking Forward

As we celebrate this milestone, we are more motivated than ever to improve netboot.xyz and add even more features that make network booting simpler and more powerful. Some of our plans include:

- Continuing to add support for more operating systems and utilities
- Improving the user experience for both novice and advanced users
- Enhancing our documentation to help new users get started
- Continuing to build out our community resources
